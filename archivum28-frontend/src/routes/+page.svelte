<br>
My Lords,<br>
<br>
I bring great tidings from the halls of our Most Holy Emperor's Archivum!<br>
<br>
Through the tireless work of my most discerning and thorough Adepts (and my of course omnipresent guidance)
we have successfully commenced our bi-millenial update of the Archivum Recordums.<br>
With the holy annointed ink of the Adeptus Atramentum, several millenia of our great Imperiums victories have now been logged.
<br>
<br>
Progress is swift, yet not without its challenges; I regret to inform the High Lords that several warp tainted 
storms have impeeded our astropathic choirs in their duties. Several thousands of whom have had to be embraced by the cleansing flames
of the Adepta Sororitas.<br>
<br>
+++ Imperial Requistion Order: Astropathic +++<br>
<br>
We shall require, at the councils convenience, for the Adeptus Astra Telepathica to present our Holy Archivums with
more rigorously conditioned psykers to enable the continued transfer of data.<br>
<br>

+++ Imperial Census Generalis +++<br>
<br>
It shall be decreed that every Imperial Citizen shall present themselves to their nearest Planetary Archivum representatives
and provide answers to all 358 questions in this cycle of the Census Generalis. Notable events are to be recorded alongside 
their location, involved parties, and any pictogram evidence that may be available.<br>
<br>
The Emperors blessing on all your excellencies!<br>
<br>
High Scriptor Archivum Drontius Lexom<br>
<br>
+++ Thought of the day: Monotony is the cornerstone of unwavering devotion.
